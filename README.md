## Dataset Link
Download the [train](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/train_32x32.mat) and [test](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test_32x32.mat) data from the links. The data folder already has the test data. However the train data is too large and you should download it before running the scripts.
